        <pre>Apple Pie Recipe:

            ### **Ingredients:**
            - **For the crust:**
              - 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
              - 1 teaspoon salt
              - 1 tablespoon sugar
              - 1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes
              - 6–8 tablespoons ice water
            
            - **For the filling:**
              - 6 cups sliced, peeled apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work well)
              - ¾ cup granulated sugar
              - ¼ cup packed brown sugar
              - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
              - 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
              - ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
              - ¼ teaspoon salt
              - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
              - 1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for a thicker filling)
            
            - **For the top:**
              - 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
              - 1 tablespoon coarse sugar (optional, for sprinkling)
            
            ### **Instructions:**
            
            1. **Prepare the crust:**
               - In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and sugar.
               - Add the cold butter cubes and cut them into the flour mixture using a pastry cutter or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
               - Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Do not overmix.
               - Divide the dough into two equal parts, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
            
            2. **Make the filling:**
               - In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Toss until the apples are well coated. Let sit for 10 minutes to draw out juices.
               - Optionally, sprinkle cornstarch into the apple mixture for a thicker filling.
               
            3. **Roll out the dough:**
               - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
               - Roll out one of the dough discs on a lightly floured surface until it’s large enough to fit into a 9-inch pie dish.
               - Gently transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it into the edges. Trim any excess dough hanging over the sides.
            
            4. **Assemble the pie:**
               - Pour the apple filling into the crust, making sure to spread it evenly.
               - Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.
               - Roll out the second dough disc and place it over the top of the pie, or cut it into strips for a lattice top.
               - Trim, fold, and crimp the edges of the pie crust together.
               - Brush the top with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar if desired.
            
            5. **Bake:**
               - Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45–55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
               - If the edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil or a pie shield halfway through baking.
            
            6. **Cool and serve:**
               - Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before slicing to allow the filling to set.
               - Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream if desired!
